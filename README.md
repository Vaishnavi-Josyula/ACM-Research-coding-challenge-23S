I used the Stars datasets on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepu1109/star-dataset) to visualize how each attribute (temperature, radius, luminosity, etc) affects the star's type. I tried to find any trends that strongly correlate with the star type - temperature and luminosity were strong predictors of star type. Then, I graphed the data from the Kaggle datset to show that it first the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram:

Please look at the ipynb file for the code and all diagrams and more details!

Overall, I really enjoyed delving deeper into visualization techniques and using online resources to complete this challenge.
If I had the opportunity to come back at a later time (i.e. after I've become more proficient in this area), I'd love to implement a machine learning model that can predict star types given other attributes.
